# ICEBERG-CHALLENGE-KAGGLE
The code is aimed for making people understand how to build complex machine learning algorithms with very simple programming using Tensorflow

Add a data from the contest - https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge/data

Put the training data in directory data/processed/train.json

Just run python main.py

Currently, the code creates only trained model, will update as it completes giving output on test data.
